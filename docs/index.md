content_title: INERY Overview
---

INERY is the next-generation blockchain platform for creating and deploying smart contracts and distributed applications. INERY comes with a number of programs. The primary ones included in INERY are the following:

* [Nodine](01_nodine/index.md) (node + ine = nodine)  - core service daemon that runs a node for block production, API endpoints, or local development.
* [Cline](02_cline/index.md) (cli + ine = cline) - command line interface to interact with the blockchain (via `nodine`) and manage wallets (via `kined`).
* [Kined](03_kined/index.md) (key + ine = kined) - component that manages INERY keys in wallets and provides a secure enclave for digital signing.

The basic relationship between these components is illustrated in the diagram below.
