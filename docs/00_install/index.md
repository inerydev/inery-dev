content_title: INERY Software Installation
---

There are various ways to install and use the INERY software:

* [Install INERY Prebuilt Binaries](00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md)
* [Build INERY from Source](01_build-from-source/index.md)

[[info]]
| If you are new to INERY, it is recommended that you install the [INERY Prebuilt Binaries](00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md), then proceed to the [Getting Started](https://developers.ine.io/inery-home/docs/) section of the [INERY Developer Portal](https://developers.ine.io/). If you are an advanced developer, a block producer, or no binaries are available for your platform, you may need to [Build INERY from source](01_build-from-source/index.md) instead.
