| Shell scripts automate the process of building, installing, testing, and uninstalling the INERY software and dependencies.

To build INERY from the source code using shell scripts, visit the sections below:

1. [Download INERY Source](01_download-inery-source.md)
2. [Build INERY Binaries](02_build-inery-binaries.md)
3. [Install INERY Binaries](03_install-inery-binaries.md)
4. [Test INERY Binaries](04_test-inery-binaries.md)
5. [Uninstall INERY](05_uninstall-inery.md)

[[info | Building INERY is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to INERY, it is recommended that you install the [INERY Prebuilt Binaries](../../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.
