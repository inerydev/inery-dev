content_title: Uninstall INERY
---

If you have previously built INERY from source and now wish to install the prebuilt binaries, or to build from source again, it is recommended to run the `inery_uninstall.sh` script within the `ine/scripts` folder:

```sh
cd ~/inery/ine
sudo ./scripts/inery_uninstall.sh
```

[[info | Uninstall Dependencies]]
| The uninstall script will also prompt the user to uninstall INERY dependencies. This is recommended if installing prebuilt INERY binaries or building INERY for the first time.
